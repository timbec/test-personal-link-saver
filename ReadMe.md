Personal Link Saver, built off Andrew Mead's 'Full Stack Meteor and React' course on Udemy.

Currently, user can:

- create an account, log in and save links.
- links are automatically shortened.
- hide or unhide those links, copy links, or go directly to link (opened in separate browser)

To Be Added:

- a timestamp to show when link was last visited, and how many times link was visited.
- Ability to tag then filter links based on tags.
- Ability to delete links.
